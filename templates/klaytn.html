        <h1 class="type">How to buy with Klaytn</h1>

        <p class="center">
            Like many enterprise blockchains, Klaytn is basically a carbon copy of Ethereum with a few minor
            differences. However, because Klaytn apparently uses an unaltered clone of the Ethereum Virtual Machine
            (EVM) for its smart contracts. This also can be used with your wallet the differences is that you exchange
            Ethereum on diffrent blockchain paying a gas fee price that can be diffrent from other block chains.
            However you have to exchange you Ethereum into Klaytn for any NFT that accepts this payment method.
