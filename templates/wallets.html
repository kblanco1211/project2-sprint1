            NFT wallets are digital wallets that help your store NFTs and cryptocurrencies in one place. The wallets
            help you in receiving additional assets alongside purchasing things with the assets in your ownership. The
            massive upsurge in NFT purchases in recent times has also led to the development of functionalities in NFT
            wallets for storing the NFT art after minting or purchasing. Interestingly, an NFT wallet does not actually
            have the assets in a digital version of a particular bank account.

            On the contrary, the wallet only stores the information regarding the location of your assets on the
            blockchain. Now, you would come across another trouble of finding an NFT wallet best suited for your needs.
            All NFT wallets have different features and you have to look out for the essential traits for avoiding any
            confusion.
